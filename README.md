# FalconSharp

FalconSharp is a client library targeting .NET 4.5 (and above) that interacts with the [Falcon Social](http://www.falconsocial.com/) API.


## Usage examples

List all of the social channels from the associated organisation account:

	var falcon = new FalconClient("api_key");
	var channels = falcon.GetChannels();
	foreach (var channel in channels.Items)
	{
		Console.WriteLine(channel.Name);
	}

Get paged social content items, (limited to 10 and after 100) from a selected social channel:

	var falcon = new FalconClient("api_key");
	var content = falcon.GetContent("channel_name", limit: 10, offset:100);
	foreach (var item in content.Items)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1} - {2}", item.Network, item.Name, item.Message);
	}
